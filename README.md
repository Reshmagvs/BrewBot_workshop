     include a URL to the product page: https://www.starbucks.com/menu
     ```

 

6. **Click on the Block Symbol**  
   - This lets you create your first building block.

   - Label the block as **`greeting`**  
   - Enter the following text:  

     ```
     Welcome to Starbucks!  
     I am Joanne, how can I assist you today?
     ```

8. **Capture User Response**  
   - Add a **Capture Response Text Block**  
   - Label it as **`capture user question`**

       ```

10. **Intent Block**  
   - Add an **Intent Block** as " order status "  
   - In Chatling, an **intent** represents the underlying goal or purpose a user wants to achieve when they interact with the chatbot.  
   - Example intents:  
     - **Order Coffee**  
     - **Check Menu**

      - **Response Source:** AI Model

        ```
        You are an order number validator. Your task is to evaluate whether a given order number 
        is valid and is in the correct format.

        The order number should meet the following criteria:
        - Contain numeric characters only
        - Must be less than four characters in length

        Here is the order number to evaluate:
        {Order_Number}

        Carefully examine the order number and determine if it meets all the specified criteria.

        If the order number is correct and meets all the criteria, output "1". 
        If the order number is incorrect or fails to meet any of the criteria, output "0".
        ```
      - **Save Response in Variable:**  
        ```
        order_num_validation
        ```

14. **Condition Block**  
    - Add a **Condition Block** labeled **`Valid Order Number?`**

      - **Label:** `order status`  
        ```
        Your order is being made and will be served soon, thank you for waiting patiently!
        ```
      - **Label:** `reprompt`  
        ```
        The order number "{Order_Number}" is invalid. 
        Please check and add a valid order number.
        ```

16. **Confirmation Step**  
    - Add a **Text Block** labeled **`confirmation`**  
    - Enter:  
      ```
      Is there anything else that I can assist you with?
      ```  
    - Add buttons: **Yes / No**

17. **End Chat**  
    - Add a **Text Block** labeled **`end chat`**  
    - Enter:
